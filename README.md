2. Close your fork's main branch from commits.

4. Commit your local changes to a newly created branch.
5. Push local changes to your remote branch.

6. Create a Pull Request from that branch back into the original repository main branch.

7. Assign reviewer and wait for comments or approve
   1. Continue your work on another fix, creating a new branch from your fork's main branch.
   2. [Create a new branch](DOCUMENTATION/branching/branching.md)
